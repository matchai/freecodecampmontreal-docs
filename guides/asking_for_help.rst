These following steps are natural for anyone having programmed for a while, but can be not so straight-forward to any new ducks. These tips are for coding problems but can be applied to pretty much anything. Everyone googles don't worry.

Step 1: Try to figure it out yourself
----------------------------------------
Play around with your code and console to try and pinpoint the root of your issue. 


Step 2. Google it
----------------------------------------
.. WARNING::
   Unless it was a very simple answer/simply something you forgot, you should implement the answers you find in a way that you are able to comprehend and not copy an entire code snippet

Google your issue, being as precise and succinct as you can. If there is an error message, google part or all of it as well as the language/library you are working with if it's not clear enough. **For most new coders, the answer will 99%** [#f1]_ **of the time have already been asked by someone equally confused in various ways**.

Check to see if the tech you're working with has docs that go along with it that can help you out. Same goes for if this is a company project, sometimes company wide docs go with.

You're most likely looking for websites with:

- StackOverflow_
- MDN_ (for html/css/javascript)
- W3School_ (**beware, only use this for simple examples and do not take everything on it for granted**)

.. [#f1] This percentage was not googled

Step 3. Ask for Help
----------------------------------------
So you tried to solve it on your own, looked through different answers online but you still don't fully understand. Great! Time to ask for a more custom answer.

Make sure you have **a specific question** to ask and make sure to either:

- post a snippet of the problematic code (this_ can help)
- point to the lines of your code where the problem lies if necessary (via GitHub, codepen or equivalent)

You can ask on StackOverflow_ , although that can be daunting and it should not be a question that has already asked. You can also ask within the discord's help channels or ping mentors (see the specialties of our mentors in the mentors section of the docs)
